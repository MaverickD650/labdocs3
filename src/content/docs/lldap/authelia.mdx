## Authelia Setup

Authelia is a highly available authentication and authorization server for your applications. It is designed to be deployed behind your reverse proxy and acts as a central point of authentication for your apps and services. It can be used to protect your apps and services with two-factor authentication, single sign-on and more. The TrueCharts implementation of Authelia has been built to be more robust with CloudNativePG integration and highly available. Cannot find a guide on the whole setup yet though so this is a work in progress.

Authelia is available in the Enterprise train of TrueCharts to act as the authentication provider for your apps and services either through OAuth or forward authentication. LLDAP can be used to manage your Authelia users and groups. To enable this as an option follow the steps outlined below. References to the specific questions as they appear in the TrueNAS SCALE UI are included in the guide and highlighted along with the answers you should use.

This guide only covers the LDAP setup of Authelia. Refer to other guides for the remaining setup of Authelia.

This is adapted from a guide I wrote for the TrueCharts project. Not published yet as I haven't been able to test the guide start to finish as I just did a rewrite of the TrueCharts implentation of LLDAP. I will update this guide once I have tested it.

## Setup instructions

1. Tick the box for `LDAP backend configuration` a further set of questions will then appear.
2. The dropdown `Implementation` should be set as `custom`
3. URL should be set to internally link back to your LLDAP instance for the default configuration it should look something like the one below.
    `ldap://lldap-ldap.ix-lldap.svc.cluster.local:3890`
This will need to be adapted if you have named LLDAP differently or used a different port for LDAP.
4. Next set the `Base DN` this is one of the configurable options you set when installing LLDAP which by default is `dc=example,dc=com` and should be adapted to your domain if set.
5. The `Username Attribute` should be set to `uid`.
6. The `Additional Users DN` should be set to `ou=people` as this is where all your users are stored.
7. The users filter can be set to one of two options depending on whether you want to allow sign in with a username or both username and email. Both options are outlined below.

    **Username only**
        `(&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=person))`

    **Username and email**
        `(&(|({username_attribute}={input})({mail_attribute}={input}))(objectClass=person))`

8. The next option that needs setting is `Additional Groups DN` must be set to `ou=groups` as this is where all your groups are stored.
9. LLDAP only supports only one filter which should be set in `Groups Filter` and set to;
    `member={dn})`
10. The `Group name Attribute` should be set to `cn`.
11. The `Mail Attribute` should simply be set to `mail`.
12. The `Display Name Attribute` should be set to `displayName`. This is the attribute that Authelia will use to greet users when they log in.
13. `Admin user` is the default admin user used when setting up LLDAP initially and is auto generated for you. The entry you input into this box should look something like the one below. Change `dc=example,dc=com` to match the `Base DN` you set earlier. Though you can use another user but make sure they are in the `LLDAP_PASSWORD_MANAGER` group.

    **Admin user**
        `uid=admin,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com`

14. Enter the admin user password into the `Password` field. As stated earlier **DO NOT** use the default password.
