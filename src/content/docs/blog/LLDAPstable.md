title: TrueCharts LLDAP Stable Release

Happy to announce the stable release of TrueCharts LLDAP! I've been squirreling away on this for a few weeks now so I'm glad it's finally ready for release.

I have added a guide for Authelia which seems to have worked very well to smooth implementation for users given it is meant to be a simple LDAP implementation. The upstream documentation is fantastic already, but I've added a few extra notes to help users get started in TrueNAS SCALE as LLDAP has few more quirky defaults that can catch users off guard. I'm happy to write more guides for other applications that can use LLDAP as a backend if there is interest and it adds value given the already great upstream documentation.

It has been a pleasure to work on this project and it's been a fantastic boost for me to see the enthusiasm for it from the community. I'm looking forward to working on more projects in the future and continuing to learn and grow as a developer.
