title: A Talos future

The apps on TrueNAS have been running ok for a while despite being limiting but with SCALE deprecating SCALE apps it's time for a new challenge.

Currently the plan is for Talos in a SCALE VM to run a kubernetes cluster closer to how it should be run. Truecharts aim to make this easier by making a clustertool to aid in setting up the cluster and make it ready for use with Fluxcd.

My plan for the future is to go fully into Gitops and Fluxcd. Hopefully, I can type up some documents to make this easier for others as well. Gitops defined Kubernetes is a great way to get an automated and resilient cluster with automated testing and updates and I can't wait to explore it further.
